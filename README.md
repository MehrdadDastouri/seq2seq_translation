# Seq2Seq Translation with LSTM

This project implements a Seq2Seq model with LSTM for translating short sentences from English to a made-up language. The architecture includes an Encoder-Decoder structure with teacher forcing during training.

## Features
- Utilizes an Encoder-Decoder architecture with LSTM.
- Trains on a small dataset of English-Spanish-like sentence pairs.
- Supports translation of new sentences after training.
